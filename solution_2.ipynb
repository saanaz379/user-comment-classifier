I have had a gastric bypass surgery and was told by my Gastric bypass surgeon to not take any extended release medication. This new Dr. told me that was not true and treated me as though I was a drug addict. I have for the last 6 years only been able to take Liquid Diazepam for my anxiety. I have never been accused of selling it or taking recreational drugs in my life! I came to him for help with my anxiety because it is horrible right now and told him my concerns with healing medical bills over the past 6 years and he adds a drug screening to it? This doctor is so concerned about my Diazepam use but yet pushes off another medication on me that I told him I cant use! I have been in contact with a bariatric surgeon and been told this is not something I should take so I will not be paying for this or picking it up. I feel he should stick to what he knows and not try to act as though he is able to make decisions when he clearly is not aware of what is ok for a bariatric patient. He was so jumpy he has my nerves worse than when I came in. I would hope you never allow this to happen to another patient it was the worst experience of my life. He is not good for patients when he himself could probably use something to calm himself down.\n",

I have had a gastric bypass surgery and was told by my Gastric bypass surgeon to not take any extended release medication. This new Dr. told me that was not true and treated me as though I was a drug addict. I have for the last 6 years only been able to take Liquid Diazepam for my anxiety. I have never been accused of selling it or taking recreational drugs in my life! I came to him for help with my anxiety because it is horrible right now and told him my concerns with healing medical bills over the past 6 years and he adds a drug screening to it? This doctor is so concerned about my Diazepam use but yet pushes off another medication on me that I told him I cant use! I have been in contact with a bariatric surgeon and been told this is not something I should take so I will not be paying for this or picking it up. I feel he should stick to what he knows and not try to act as though he is able to make decisions when he clearly is not aware of what is ok for a bariatric patient. He was so jumpy he has my nerves worse than when I came in. I would hope you never allow this to happen to another patient it was the worst experience of my life. He is not good for patients when he himself could probably use something to calm himself down.\n",
